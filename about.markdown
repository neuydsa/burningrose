Burning Rose is the official magazine of YDSA Northeastern, a campus wing of Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). DSA has over 92,000 members, including Congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez & Rashida Tlaib. At Burning Rose, we aim to reflect the voices of young socialists at Northeastern. 

As socialists, we believe that the economy should be run democratically by workers, the U.S. imperial empire must be dismantled globally, and that the liberation of all oppressed peoples requires the abolition of capitalism. We can only achieve these goals through unifying the working class through our common struggle. 

YDSA Northeastern is led by a democratically elected Central Committee, which establishes chapter priorities, organizes meetings, manages funds, and ensures that the chapter grows and develops in healthy ways. YDSA Northeastern began as Huskies for Bernie, where countless Northeastern students volunteered for Bernie Sanders’ 2020 presidential campaign. After Sanders dropped out of the presidential race in April 2020, Huskies for Bernie’s most active volunteers transitioned their socialist efforts to form YDSA Northeastern. Since its creation in May 2020, YDSA Northeastern has amassed over 200 members, and has become one of the most active political groups on campus. 

At YDSA Northeastern, we campaign for socialist politicians, canvas with local tenants unions, work to effect change at Northeastern, and publish socialist articles written for our magazine, Burning Rose. Our Northeastern efforts include our pass/fail campaign in Fall 2020, our Spring 2020 campaigns to reduce meal plan prices and T-fares, and our fight against the construction of private luxury housing at Northeastern. In the future, we hope to recruit more Northeastern students to organize towards our common goal of socialism.
