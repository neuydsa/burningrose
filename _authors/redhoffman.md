Red Hoffmann (they/them) is a third-year psychology pre-medical student. They joined YDSA after self-studying political theory as a way of putting what they learned into action. Having worked prior in mutual aid and mass action, they believe that theory is an important accompaniment to praxis, but one can never replace the other. They work as a staff columnist and help with political education events. Originally from tristate-area Connecticut, they spent the 4 years prior to university living in Spain and their first semester in Germany. Despite only recently having joined the YDSA, they hope to become more involved and make change where it counts.
