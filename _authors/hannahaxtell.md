Hannah Axtell (she/her) is a second-year Environmental Science student with minors in political science and Spanish. She joined YDSA Northeastern after learning more about the racial, gender, wealth, and class inequities in the country prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. She is a contributing member of YDSAâ€™s Electoral, Communications, and Housing Working Groups as well as a prospective writer and editor for the Burning Rose. She is originally from Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, but could not be more excited to be involved in the Boston solidarity movement. Although a new member to YDSA this year, she will be taking on the role of Electoral Working Group Chair this upcoming Fall. She hopes to use the platform to advocate for social justice on local and national stages.
