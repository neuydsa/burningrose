Now and forever, YDSA Northeastern will unequivocally support the Palestinian people in their struggle for liberation, from the river to the sea. The forced expulsion of families from their homes in Sheikh Jarrah, the storming of Al-Aqsa mosque during some of the most holy days of Ramadan, and the renewal of the siege on Gaza, which has claimed the lives of 56 Palestinians, 14 of them children, are but a few of the countless atrocities committed by Israel since its founding 73 years ago.

In light of this continuing violence against Palestinians, we are extremely concerned that the Northeastern Student Government Association has made no efforts to rescind its adoption of the IHRA definition of antisemitism, a partisan declaration that essentially forbids all criticism of Israel and equates anti-Zionism with antisemitism. As proud socialists and anti-imperialists, we refuse to be silenced by this blatant attempt to censor pro-Palestine voices at Northeastern.  

Following the lead of Students for Justice in Palestine, we are calling on SGA to immediately revoke its endorsement of the IHRA definition. We urge all Northeastern students to sign [SJP's petition](https://www.change.org/p/students-protect-pro-palestine-voices-from-censorship-at-northeastern-university?utm_content=cl_sharecopy_28807185_en-US%3A7&recruiter=1191715539&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=copylink&utm_campaign=share_petition) (bit.ly/NEUNOIHRA) and raise this issue with SGA leadership. Protecting Jewish students from hate can and must be done without shielding an apartheid state from legitimate criticism.

In Solidarity,

Young Democratic Socialists of America at Northeastern University Steering Committee
