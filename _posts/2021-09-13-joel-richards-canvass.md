Last Saturday, YDSA Northeastern joined [Boston DSA](https://www.bostondsa.org/), [Boston Teachers Union](https://btu.org/) (BTU), and 3 other campus chapters in a canvas for Boston City Council candidate [Joel Richards](https://www.moreford4.com/). The event, attended by Joel Richards and cosponsored by Northeastern’s, Harvard’s, Boston University’s, and Tufts’ YDSAs, garnered roughly 80 volunteers. In one day, this coalition of socialists, teachers, and students knocked on over 2,300 doors in preparation for [Tuesday’s City Council election](https://www.sec.state.ma.us/WhereDoIVoteMA/bal/MyElectionInfo.aspx). Of the volunteers, 30 were Northeastern students, most of whom had never canvassed before.

Joel Richards is one of 12 candidates endorsed this cycle by Boston DSA, joining incumbents and challengers across the Boston area in an ambitious bid to form the country’s first modern socialist majority on a city council in Somerville. If elected, he and District 6 candidate Kendra Hicks would serve as the first two socialists on Boston City Council⁠—ever.

“Canvassing isn’t just about the candidate for us,” said Jordan Buchman, chair of YDSA Northeastern. “Of course Joel is incredible, but we’re part of DSA and we take that very seriously. So when we found out that one of our candidates needed some help before the preliminary election, that was all we needed to hear”. The other YDSA chapters participating in the canvass also demonstrated their commitment to the greater socialist project, turning out members even though they aren’t in District 4 or Boston altogether. 

In more ways than one, the Boston socialist movement showed its incredible strength at Saturday’s canvas. For new YDSA members, the canvas was an intimate learning experience about local politics. For returning members, it was a promising glimpse into the future of activism among the American youth. Two students even got to canvass alongside Richards himself!

“It was a very unique experience for me in that Joel Richards and his team immediately welcomed us all into their campaign family,” said Hannah Axtell, electoral organizer with YDSA Northeastern. “I’m grateful for our members who took time out of their Saturday to come out, and our comrades at Boston DSA for connecting us with the opportunity!”

Joel Richards is one of 11 candidates running to represent District 4, an area comprising parts of Dorchester, Jamaica Plain, Roslindale, and Mattapan. District 4’s city council seat was vacated by its current representative, Andrea Campbell, when she launched her Boston mayoral campaign. With so many candidates to choose from, District 4’s ballot is as confusing as it is overwhelming. For Boston socialists, the choice is clear: vote Joel Richards!

## Who is Joel Richards?

Joel Richards is a proud teacher, union organizer, minister, and first generation Jamaican-American. Richards runs on a platform that supports Boston’s most vulnerable residents: immigrants, people of color, renters, workers, and the LGBTQ+ community. Richards’ campaign slogan, “More for District 4”, is indicative of his mission to uplift District 4 through affordable housing and high-quality education.

If elected, Joel Richards hopes to unite Boston’s working class in the fight against rising inequality, gentrification, and white supremacy. Richards will prioritize the people’s demands over the interests of big corporations and developers: a stark shift from District 4’s previous politics. His policy platform is as follows:

### Education

Before anything else, Joel is a teacher. Joel Richards is a Boston public school teacher of 14 years: he has experienced the shortcomings of Boston’s public school system first hand. If elected, Joel will work with parents, students, and the Boston Teachers Union to give students the education experience that they deserve.

Joel Richards believes that schools should be fully staffed so that each classroom can have an appropriate teacher-student ratio. Boston classrooms are overcrowded and underfunded: students don’t get quality education, and teachers are overworked. As City Councilor, Richards will call for hearings between experts, teachers, parents, and community leaders so that he can implement and fund a proper teacher-student ratio.

If elected, Joel Richards will ensure District 4’s education budget is transparent and easily accessible to promote student success through public investment. Ricards proposes the creation of a “Budget Education Council”, which would employ educators and community leaders to make graphics, interactive videos, and posts to inform the public about the education budget. 

Richards is a strong proponent of *publicly elected school committees*. District 4’s current School Committee consistently ignores community demands because it is represented by one unelected official. Through public elections, future officials will be held accountable, and the community will finally have a say in the future of District 4’s education.

Schools are launchpads for education and careers for today’s students. Unfortunately, Boston’s public schools lack proper programs to uplift students. Joel Richards promises to work with education experts, the community, and community colleges to *create programs that will help students prepare for higher education* and the workforce. Through vocational and certification programs, and community college education, students can better prepare for the real world.

### Housing

As a former renter and current homeowner, Joel Richards is painfully aware of District 4’s housing affordability challenges. Tenant rights and housing affordability are at the forefront of his campaign: through housing programs Richards will uplift financially vulnerable people, and those who have been systematically stunted by Boston’s racist housing policies.

An increasing number of District 4 residents *spend 50% or more of their income on rent*, preventing them from buying a home in Boston, and generating generational wealth. As a result of this trend, countless tenants have left District 4 to find more affordable housing in other areas. Joel Richards promises to, “expand… housing lotteries so that working class people [can] attain homeownership at an affordable price….[and] provide municipal funds to incentivize the development of truly affordable housing.”

Homelessness is an issue that Joel Richards believes Boston, one of the wealthiest cities in America, should not have. As City Councilor, Richards will fight to fund transitional housing, homeless shelters, and homelessness prevention programs in District 4. 

Tenant protection is a priority to Joel Richards. If elected, Richards hopes to *extend Boston’s eviction moratorium* once Boston’s pandemic induced financial recession ends. Richards wholeheartedly supports tenants’ right to organize and unionize to improve their living conditions. He believes that tenants are entitled to the right of first refusal, which allows tenants to buy the property they live in if their landlord sells it. On every level, Joel Richards stands with Boston renters.

### Environment

Joel Richards is a strong proponent of the Boston Green New Deal. As a father of two boys, Richards wants to create a future where his children can live without the threat of environmental disaster. Through his support of the Boston Green New Deal, Richards pushes for carbon neutrality, sustainable energy, fare-free & reliable transportation, and union green jobs.

Rising sea levels are a looming concern for Boston, a city by the sea. Joel Richards believes that we must act fast against climate change by switching to renewable energy whenever possible, and decarbonizing Boston. As City Councilor, Richards will strive to, “Commit Boston to a net-zero municipal footprint by 2024, 100 percent renewable electricity by 2030, and citywide carbon neutrality by 2040.”

Cars are the leading cause of pollution in Massachusetts. If elected, Joel Richards will fight for free, abundant, and electrically powered transportation in Boston.
