Maya Harel (she/her) is a second-year Political Science and Communications student at Northeastern University and a writer for the Burning Rose. She has been involved in YDSA since its founding in April 2020. She was previously the Electoral WG Chair, but will serve as YDSA’s Vice Chair in the Fall 2021 semester. Maya is originally from Tenafly, New Jersey, a small suburb that neighbors the George Washington Bridge, and loves to go back to visit her friends and family, but most importantly, her dog Pumpkin. She was introduced to socialism at a young age through her youth movement Hashomer Hatzair and has acted on these views through political activism, awareness/education, and heated discussions with friends/family members, among other things. Maya loves YDSA’s emphasis on taking action in our community and can’t wait to continue on the fight to expand our impact and grow our membership to become the largest and most active political group on campus.
