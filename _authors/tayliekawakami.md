Taylie Kawakami (she/her) is a first-year Communications Studies and Graphic and Information Design student at Northeastern University. She is an illustrator and graphic designer for Burning Rose and began working with the group in the Spring of 2021. Born and raised in Maui, Hawai’i, she decided to take a leap of faith and move all the way to Boston to pursue higher education. As a proud Asian American and someone who deals with mental illnesses, Taylie is a huge advocate for the AAPI movement and mental health awareness. She will often use art as an outlet for political advocacy and to raise awareness. She illustrated every article in Burning Rose’s first print edition, and looks forward to illustrating more editions in the future.
